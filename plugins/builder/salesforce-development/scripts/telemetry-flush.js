/*
 * telemetry-flush.js — Stream B transmitter for the salesforce-development plugin.
 *
 * The Python hooks NEVER touch the network. On session end, `sf-context
 * telemetry-flush` renames the session's own buffer to a private snapshot and spawns
 * a detached Python sender (`telemetry-send`); that sender resolves the org, writes a
 * pending job to .sf/telemetry-pending-<pid>.json, and spawns THIS script detached —
 * so the upload outlives the hook and never blocks it, the same shape as the SF CLI's
 * own detached `plugin-telemetry` uploader.
 *
 * This is a deliberately thin transmitter: all scrubbing, allowlisting, and the
 * event mapping already happened in Python (sf_telemetry.py). Here we only read
 * the pending job (argv[2]), resolve @salesforce/telemetry (+ @salesforce/core for
 * O11y) from the INSTALLED SF CLI's node_modules (the CLI bundles them; we don't
 * vendor our own), and hand the pre-shaped events to the O11y sink:
 *
 *   - O11y leg (job.events + job.a4dEvents): create an O11y-enabled reporter whose
 *     getConnectionFn opens the connected org, so the upload goes through
 *     /services/data/vXX/connect/proxy/ui-telemetry on the org's instance. It
 *     carries TWO event SHAPES on the one transport: the fixed PdpEvent
 *     (job.events, via sendPdpEvent) and the flexible UIP shape (job.a4dEvents, via
 *     sendTelemetryEvent — o11y schema sf_a4dInstrumentation, feeding UIP Hive ->
 *     Tableau). Then flush/stopAsync. Needs job.username (an org).
 *
 * The leg is fail-open: any error just means telemetry didn't send this session.
 * Exit code is always 0 — a telemetry failure must never look like a real error.
 * The pending file is deleted in a finally block (like the CLI uploader) so a
 * transient failure doesn't wedge the buffer or re-send next session.
