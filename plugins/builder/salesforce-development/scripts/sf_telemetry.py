"""sf_telemetry — usage-telemetry capture + O11y-PDP transmit for the salesforce-development plugin.

**Stream A ("Capturing telemetry")** — consent-gated, scrubbed, local-only event
capture: hooks append scrubbed events to a local JSONL buffer, no network on the
hot path.

**Stream B ("Transmitting telemetry")** — on session end, a detached Node flusher
reads the buffer, maps each event to a Salesforce O11y **PDP event**
(`productFeatureId` = the suite's GUS Feature Record) and uploads it through the
connected org's `/services/data/vXX/connect/proxy/ui-telemetry` endpoint, exactly
as the SF CLI's own `plugin-telemetry` uploader does (reusing the bundled
`@salesforce/telemetry` `TelemetryReporter.sendPdpEvent`). Transmit is still fully
consent-gated: `off` / `SF_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` / `DO_NOT_TRACK` discard the buffer
so there is nothing to send, and with no connected org O11y simply no-ops.

Invoked via the `sf-context` wrapper, which delegates any `telemetry*` command here:

    sf-context telemetry <on|off|status>      Consent control (backs /salesforce-development:telemetry)
    sf-context telemetry-capture <event> [outcome]
                                               Capture one event from a hook payload on stdin.
                                               event ∈ {session_start, command_invoked,
                                                        skill_dispatched, exception, mcp_tool_used}
                                               outcome (command_invoked only) ∈ {success, failure}
    sf-context telemetry-flush                 Spawn the detached Node flusher (SessionEnd hook).
    sf-context telemetry-transmit              Run the transmit synchronously (used by the flusher
                                               and by tests; prints a JSON result, never spawns).

Design guarantees (POC-level, mirroring the plan):
    * Default-ON, but a true hard-off. `off` — or the ecosystem `SF_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`
      / `DO_NOT_TRACK` signals — means nothing is captured, buffered, or written.
    * Positive allowlist. Only approved fields per event type ever reach the buffer;
      anything else (code, paths, flag *values*, raw errors) is dropped before write.
    * Identity mirrors the CLI. machine_id reuses the CLI's CLIID when present. The
      raw orgId is never ENVELOPED on a buffered record and never rides the PDP
      shape — it carries only a coarse org_bucket
      (production/sandbox/scratch/none). The UIP flexible format (O11y
      sf_a4dInstrumentation schema) event shape ALONE carries the raw
      org id (when live-resolved at transmit), disclosed in the first-run notice,
      so the analytics UIP pipeline can key on it. org_id is never persisted to the
      local cache (which stores only the coarse bucket + transmit-only username).
    * Fail-silent. Any error is swallowed — telemetry never blocks or breaks a hook.

    Thin stdin/stdout wrapper over `capture_event`: reads the hook payload, records
    the event, and always prints a benign `{"continue": true}` so it composes with
    other hooks on the same event. Used for the events wired as standalone plugin
    hooks (session_start, skill_dispatched, agent_dispatched, mcp_tool_used,
    command_invoked failure, exception). The successful-Bash `command_invoked` path
    is instead captured in-process by the post-bash dispatcher, which calls
    `capture_event` directly so the PostToolUse Bash block stays a single, race-free
    hook.

    DISCLOSURE: the `session_start` hook is ALSO the universal first-run-notice
    trigger. It fires in EVERY ui_mode (full/compact/plain/off) and from any project
    subdirectory — unlike cmd_detect's banner, which only renders in full mode from
    the project root. So this is where we guarantee the notice is shown to EVERY
    user before any non-session event is captured (capture_event enforces the
    matching gate). We call the SAME atomic fire-once first_run_notice_lines(): its
    exclusive-create marker is a cross-process mutex, so whichever of {detect,
    this hook} runs first shows the notice and the other sees it already shown —
    the notice appears exactly once. In full mode from the root, detect usually wins

    A PDP event carries only {eventName, productFeatureId, componentId,

    fidelity always stays in the local buffer. eventName follows PDP's
    `<object>.<action>` convention (lowerCamelCase object, one-word past-tense
    action). Returns None for an unknown/garbled record so it is skipped, not sent.

    `org_bucket` (optional) overrides the coarse org classification used by the

    the UIP `message` field (o11y schema `sf_a4dInstrumentation`) and delivers

    UIP is a SCHEMA/event shape, not a new sink — it rides the existing O11y

    `org_id` — the raw connected-org id. Threaded here ONLY (never into PDP or App
    Insights, which stay coarse `org_bucket`-only) so the analytics team's

    no org id. The sole caller (_build_transmit_payload) passes the live-resolved
    org_id, so a live-resolved transmit DOES egress the raw org id on the UIP shape;
